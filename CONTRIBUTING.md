## About the framework

This project utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering.  Additional documentation on Next.js can be found [here](https://zeit.co/blog/next).

>"Next.js gives you a server that extracts the state into an object and then injects the state back in the client. Beyond that it provides a method for 'smart containers', what they call pages that is called getInitialProps which is run both on server and client."

React + Redux works as traditionally expected.
