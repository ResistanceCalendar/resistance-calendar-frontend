        "description": "Corrections Corporation of America is one of the largest for profit prison companies making millions off the Mass Incarceration of Blacks and the Poor through lobbying, direct campaign contributions and increasing their influence politically. CCA was quoted in their 2014 Annual Report: \"The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\" Do not allow CCA to profit from Mass Incarceration. Join us in Protesting CCA's private industry for profit \"slavery\". \n\nUPDATE: The Corrections Corporation of America, GEO Group, and the Avalon Corporation all have facilities in the Austin, Texas area and Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Barclays Intl. and Merrlin Lynch have invested in private prisons. In honor of the Robert Sobukwe who lead a demonstration to a Soweto, South Africa police station on March 21, 1960 and those who lost their lives protesting apartheid and police brutality at the Sharpeville Massacre on March 21, 1960 at a Sharpeville police station, we will continue to uphold the date of March 21. We will make this a mass protest with organizations and advocates working to dismantle the prison industrial complex in the fields of mental health, rehabilitation, recidivsm, and criminal justice. \n\nFURTHER UPDATE: To avoid displacement of the residents of the Austin Transitional Center, 3154 East Highway 71, Austin, Texas 78617 we have moved this event to next year 2018 back to the GEO Group's new headquarters 1777 NE Loop 410, San Antonio, Texas 78217.",

        "description": "\"What can I do?\"  \n\nSince the election, that's the question everyone's been asking - especially in North Carolina, where we've recently seen seen rampant abuse of power by the GOP-dominated state legislature (see http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/12\/14\/us\/politics\/north-carolina-governor-roy-cooper-republicans.html?_r=0)..\n\nThis event is a simple way to make a BIG difference. It exists solely to remind people that North Carolina is having a special election in 2017 for many legislative districts across the state.  \n\nWhy are we having a special election in 2017?  Because a federal court has ordered us to redraw many of our districts due to the unlawful use of race in the last round of redistricting (see http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/politics-government\/state-politics\/article117843388.html).  And new districts means new elections.\n\nHere's the big opportunity: If we can pick up a small handful of seats, we can break the GOP supermajority and sustain Gov. Cooper's vetoes.  Unlocking Gov. Cooper's veto would bring an abrupt halt to the far-right freight train that keeps pulling our state into the national news in ways that don't make us look good.\n\nThe key to winning those races is going to be getting out the vote, and this event is a simple tool to help do that.\n\nHere's all you need to do:\n\n1) Join our event.\n\n2) Share the event on your page (and re-share on your page whenever you think your friends need a reminder).\n\n3) ***Most Important*** - Invite your friends to join the event by clicking \"invite friends\" on the right-hand side of the event.  You can invite up to 500 friends.  Even if they don't join, they'll see the name of the event and that will tell them there's an election in 2017.\n\nThat's it!  Then, once you're done, check out our 2017 Gameplan at http:\/\/www.jeffjacksonnc.com\/gameplan-2017\/ for more easy, effective ways to lend a hand.",

        "description": "It was first announced on the neo-Nazi website Stormfront although it isn't being promoted heavily on the American Renaissance website itself, but considering the fact that the Age of Trump has meant the neo-Fascists in this country are being confronted by those who do not want those ideals running this society, they know that AmRen 2017 is going to be met with opposition. That's probably why the theme of this year's conference is \"Turning the Tide\", That's not just a reference to what they think might be happening during Trump's reign. It is also the name of a popular antifa publication by Anti-Racist Action L.A.-People Against Racist Terror! That's a good sign that they are picking a fight, but this is the year where all realize that we do indeed need to come out and protect our freedoms like never before. Montgomery Bell Park Inn just might find itself with the biggest anti-AmRen rally they have seen since AmRen had been hosting conferences there in 2013.\n\nThe American Renaissance Conference - AmRen for short - is sponsored by the newsletter published by White Supremacist Jared Taylor, considered the godfather of the so-called 'alt-right\". It will be held at  Montgomery Bell State Park Inn, 45 minutes from Nashville, Tennessee and there is no public transportation there. They chose this location not just because it is a public facility - which means by the way that the public has a right to be inside the conference center that we should say has a great restaurant - but because it is so remote. That's not going to deter folks this time around, and the fact that this is taking place in the summer as opposed to the usual spring outings they have, expect that even more.",
